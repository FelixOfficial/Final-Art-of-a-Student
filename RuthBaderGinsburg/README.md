###### Diva dissenter

Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the liberal conscience of America’s Supreme Court, died on September 18th, aged 87

美国联邦最高法院的良知，自由派法官鲁斯·巴德·金斯伯格，于2020年9月18日逝世，享年87岁。

On the evening of July 11th 2015, Ruth Bader Ginsburg went to the opera. There was nothing odd in that. Opera, after the law, was her great love, the only place where she could leave the legal world behind. When she worked on her opinions, often into the small hours if her husband Marty was not around to make her go to bed, she would usually have opera, or some other beautiful music, playing in the background. The talent she most coveted was to have a glorious voice, like Renata Tebaldi perhaps. As it was, she sang only in the shower and in her dreams.



2015年7月11日晚，鲁斯·巴德·金斯伯格去看了场歌剧。这不足为奇，因为除了法律之外，歌剧是她的最爱，只有身在歌剧院她才能（暂时）放下法律事务。鲁斯·巴德·金斯伯格撰写法庭意见时，通常会工作到凌晨，如果丈夫没在身边督促她早点上床休息，她经常会播放歌剧或者一些优美的音乐。她最渴望拥有的天赋就是一副像丽娜塔·苔巴尔迪那样的金嗓子。然而现实中她只在淋浴和睡梦中唱歌。



This particular opera, however, “Scalia/Ginsburg”, by Derrick Wang, was about her. It featured Antonin Scalia, then the court’s most scathing conservative, and she, its most notorious liberal, duelling musically in the styles of Mozart, Verdi and Puccini. He had to go through various trials; she helped him out, at one point soaring through a glass ceiling in the character of the Queen of the Night from “The Magic Flute”.



不过，德里克·王创作的歌剧《斯卡利亚/金斯伯格》就是关于鲁斯·巴德·金斯伯格的。当时，在美国联邦最高法院，安东宁·斯卡利亚是最“尖锐”的保守派；而鲁斯·巴德·金斯伯格则是最“声名狼藉”的自由派。歌剧讲述了两人之间的争斗，音乐风格则融合了莫扎特、威尔第和普契尼。斯卡利亚要经受种种考验；而金斯伯格则帮他摆脱困境，有一次是扮作《魔笛》中的夜女王，冲破玻璃天花板来救急。



She loved it all. She and Scalia, despite the legal zingers he tossed in her direction, had been best buddies since their days together on the dc federal appeals court in the 1980s. And America’s highest court could be just as dramatic, even if more sombrely arrayed. There she sat, this tiny little woman perched among the black-robed men, and there she disagreed. For all but three of her 27 years she had one or two sisterly colleagues, but her opinions still marked her out. She berated the court when, in 2014, it let employers foist their religious beliefs on their workers by not paying for cover for contraception. She was outraged when, in the Citizens United case of 2010, it refused to limit corporate funding of independent political broadcasts, as if America had all the democracy that money could buy. And she especially attacked the striking down, in 2013, of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v Holder, on the supposition that racism had waned enough to discard it. That, she wrote, was “like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.”



她特别中意这部歌剧。尽管斯卡利亚在法律工作中屡屡反驳金斯伯格，但是他俩从20世纪80年代在华盛顿联邦上诉法院共事起，就一直是最要好的朋友。美国联邦最高法院内也充满戏剧性，只不过演员的服饰更加灰暗罢了。法庭上，身材瘦小的她坐在一群身着黑色长袍的男人当中，格外显眼；而且她常提出异议。金斯伯格在最高法院工作了27年，尽管其中24年都有一两名女法官与之共事，然而她撰写的法庭意见仍然让她显得与众不同。2014年，她怒斥最高法院，因为它允许雇主以不支付避孕险的方式将宗教信仰强加给雇员。2010年，在“联合公民诉联邦选举委员会案”中，最高法院拒绝限制企业对独立政治广播节目的资助，好像美国的民主是有钱就可以买，对此，她特别愤怒。2013年，在“谢尔比县诉霍尔德案”中，最高法院裁决废止《选举权法》第5条，理由是种族主义已经消退，无需该法律条文。她严厉抨击这一裁决。她在法庭异议中写道，“这就像因你自己没有淋湿而在暴雨中丢掉雨伞”。



Being contrary, she needed to be extra sharp. She took pride in the speed with which she wrote opinions, and in their clarity. Twice a week she lifted weights, did push-ups and generally honed herself into a lean, Armani-clad contender. In oral argument she liked to leap in first, keen to establish at the start whether the plaintiff had really been damaged, or not. (Her shy, soft, pause-filled delivery off the bench really speeded up then, to Brooklyn fast.) She often announced her dissents orally, from the bench, to show how much she disagreed, and in the trying 5-4 years when she regularly led the dissenters she made sure they spoke with one voice. On those days she wore her “dissenting collar”, a grey, stony, quietly menacing number. It fitted the occasion nicely.



因为总提反对意见，金斯伯格必须格外敏锐。她撰写法律意见速度快且条理清晰，对此她很是自豪。她每周健身两次，举哑铃、做俯卧撑，身材练得清瘦而有力，是个穿阿玛尼的异见者。在口头辩论中，她喜欢先发制人，热衷于一开篇就确认原告是不是确实受到侵害。（她一开始轻声细语，带有停顿的发言到后面就会语速加快，开启布鲁克林模式。）金斯伯格为了表示强烈反对，常常在法官席上口头宣读异议意见，在那些四对五奋力抗争保守派的年月里， 她常常领导异见者，确保大家统一口径。在发表异议意见的日子里，她佩戴“异议项圈”，那是一副灰色缀满小宝石的荷叶领，代表着无声的抗议，非常适合这种场合。

menacing, intended to threaten or frighten someone



Yet she did not see herself as disruptive, let alone an activist. If she became more of a dissenter with the years, it was because the court, after 2006, swung over to the activist right. At heart she was still what she had always been, a judicial minimalist. She was stunned by the lack of caution in the Roe v Wade ruling of 1973 that legalised abortion; though she certainly approved of the outcome, reform should have come through state legislatures, where it was slowly starting to appear. She was shocked too when the court, while upholding Obamacare, found it illegal under the commerce clause of the constitution; that had been Congress’s domain since the 1930s. In her dissents she sometimes appealed to Congress to correct the law and occasionally, to her delight, it did.



然而，金斯伯格认为自己不是捣乱分子，更不是激进主义者。随着时间的推移，她在异见者的道路上越走越远，因为最高法院在2006年之后转向右翼激进主义。她内心深处，一如既往仍然秉持最初的司法极简主义。 1973年，最高法院裁决“罗诉韦德案”变相承认堕胎合法，她虽然赞成判决结果，但对判决的草率极为不满。她认为联邦各个州立法机构应该进行改革，而这种改革当时正在慢慢展现（原文state legislatures是复数，所以我的理解是立法机构的意思。就是因为判决很草率，所以她认为州立法机构应该实施改革，改变这一状态）。当支持奥巴马医改法案的最高法院却依据宪法商业条款判定医改法案非法时，她震惊万分，而自上世纪30年代以来宪法就属于国会的权利范围（这里是否需要说明，美国国会是立法机构，最高法院只能根据法律作出裁决。所以因为法律的制定由国会把持，所以法院按照法律条文判决得出了和法院自己相反的结论）。在异议意见书中，她有时也会呼吁国会修正宪法，而令她欣喜的是，国会偶尔也会采纳她的建议。

1.Commerce Clause: The Commerce Clause is a provision of the U.S. Constitution (Article 1, Section 8) that grants Congress the power “to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes." This law gives the federal government the power to regulate interstate commerce, which it defines as the sale, purchase, or exchange of commodities or the transportation of people, money, or goods between different states. 

2.Congress has historically cited the Commerce Clause as justification for laws and regulations controlling the activities of the states and their citizens. In some instances, these laws lead to controversy over the constitutional division between the powers of the federal government and rights of the states.

Her legal hero was an incrementalist: Thurgood Marshall, the first black justice on the court, who had laboured to dismantle segregation. Even when she was (as she operatically liked to say) a flaming feminist litigator, bringing cases before the Supreme Court in the 1970s on behalf of the Women’s Rights Project at the aclu, she saw herself first as a teacher, instructing the all-male court how women felt about laws which “protected” and thus demeaned them. She could have been furious about the prejudice she had faced herself, being Jewish as well as a woman: failing, for example, to get job offers from any New York law firm after leaving Columbia Law School, though she became the first tenured professor there. But she proceeded carefully, politely, case by case, and bad laws tumbled. When she joined the highest court her success rate fell, but her approach, as only the second woman there, was often the same: to explain to the male justices how it felt to be barred from the Virginia Military Institute or, as a teenage girl, to be strip-searched. Because the court just did not know these things.



她的法律界偶像是渐进主义者瑟古德·马歇尔（Thurgood Marshall）。马歇尔是美国最高法院第一位黑人大法官，毕生致力于消除种族隔离。上世纪70年代，她作为激昂的女权诉讼律师（她喜欢用歌剧风格来表达），代表美国民权联盟（ACLU）的女权计划向最高法院提起诉讼。即便在那时，她也先把自己当成老师，向清一色男性大法官的法庭阐明女性对号称“保护”实则贬低她们的法律的看法。尽管她后来成为哥伦比亚法学院第一位获得终身教职的女性，但是刚从法学院毕业那会儿，身为女性又是犹太裔的她在纽约的每一家律所都碰了壁。对自己遭受的偏见，她本可以怒不可遏，然而，她却稳扎稳打，不失风度地往前推进，通过一桩又一桩的案子，让糟糕的法律再也站不住脚（这一句话是否可以作为前一段的一个补充，就是在案子的判决结果可以反过来影响国会立法）。进入最高法院工作后，她斗争的成功率下降（这里不是胜诉率，因为进入最高法院之后她已经不再打官司，而更多的是作为大法官倡导一些法律的制定或者消除，或者对法律的解读和判决，继续推动平权，继续为每个人发声。也就是说不是单个案子的成功率，而是她倡导的议题的成功率），但她（对法律理想的追求）（作为那里仅有的两名女性大法官）一如既往：向男性大法官解释女性被弗吉尼亚军事学院拒收的痛楚，少女被强迫脱衣搜身的屈辱。因为最高法院并不了解这些。



The role of women’s champion was too narrow, though. Her arguments in discrimination cases were based squarely on the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws. Gross generalisations about “how women were” or “how men were” had to be forgotten. Her dream was a world in which men and women cared for their children equally and had equal opportunities themselves. And the constitution had to embrace everyone: Lilly Ledbetter, struggling to achieve equal pay; Stephen Wiesenfeld, trying as a widower to get the same benefits as a widow would; Maetta Vance, afraid to tell a racist supervisor to buzz off; the young men of 18 in Oklahoma who just wanted to buy a beer, as girls of 18 could. She spoke for all such everyday people.



但女性捍卫者这一角色对她来说还太过狭隘。她在性别歧视相关案件中的抗辩直接基于第十四条宪法修正案中法律对男女平等保护的规定。她认为应该摒弃“女人怎样”或者“男人怎样”这种带有偏见的概括。她梦想世上的男人和女人平等地照顾他们的孩子，并且各自拥有平等的机会。宪法应该保护每一个人，包括努力争取男女同工同酬的莉莉·莱德贝特，争取与寡妇相同权益的鳏夫斯蒂芬·维森菲尔德，不敢叫种族歧视的上司滚开的梅塔·万斯，还有希望和女性一样满18岁就可以买啤酒的俄克拉荷马州的年轻男子子。她为所有这样的普通人发声。



As the court shifted steadily rightward she became more determined to stay on. She redoubled her exercises, despite her age and the bouts of cancer, colorectal and pancreatic, which annoyingly forced her one day to take part in oral arguments from her bed. She found herself becoming an icon, a face on t-shirts and the subject of biopics: Notorious RBG, mystifying but fun. What did not change was her regard for her colleagues, conservative or not, in the wonderfully civilised family that was the court. For each of them, after all, their basic motivation was the same. At the end of “Scalia/Ginsburg”, the two famous foes-and-friends sang together the aria which was her favourite: “Separate strands unite in friction/To protect our country’s core...And this is why we will see justice done./We are different;/We are one.”



随着法院逐渐右倾，她要为所有人发声的决心也愈加坚定。尽管年事已高，又饱受结肠直肠癌和胰腺癌折磨（这两种癌症最终迫使她有一天不得不在病床上参与口头辩论），她却加倍锻炼。她发现自己变成了偶像。人们将她的头像印在T恤上，并为她拍摄纪录片《声名狼藉的鲁斯·巴德·金斯伯格》，既神秘又有趣。而在最高法这个高度文明的大家庭里，她对同事们（不论保守与否）的尊重一直没有变。毕竟，对每个法官来说，他们学法律的初衷都是一样的。在歌剧《斯卡利亚/金斯伯格》的结尾，两位著名的亦敌亦友大法官合唱她最喜欢的咏叹调：“分离的两条线在摩擦中融合/为了共同保护国家的根基……正因为此我们看到了正义的到来/我们各有不同/我们合而为一。”
