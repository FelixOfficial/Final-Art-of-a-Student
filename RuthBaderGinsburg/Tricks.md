### 技巧1. 优先记住看得懂的新内容

Being contrary, she needed to be extra sharp. She took pride in the speed with which she wrote opinions, and in their clarity. Twice a week she lifted weights, did push-ups and generally honed herself into a lean, Armani-clad contender. In oral argument she liked to leap in first, keen to establish at the start whether the plaintiff had really been damaged, or not. (Her shy, soft, pause-filled delivery off the bench really speeded up then, to Brooklyn fast.) She often announced her dissents orally, from the bench, to show how much she disagreed, and in the trying 5-4 years when she regularly led the dissenters she made sure they spoke with one voice. On those days she wore her “dissenting collar”, a grey, stony, quietly menacing number. It fitted the occasion nicely.

**Being contrary**, she needed to be **extra** sharp. She took pride in the speed with which she **wrote opinions**, and in their **clarity**. Twice a week she **lifted weights**, did **push-ups** and **generally** honed **herself into** a lean, Armani-clad contender. In oral argument **she liked** to leap in first, keen to establish at the start **whether** the plaintiff had really **been damaged, or not**.

#### 坚持用中文串联

她相反，她需要额外的。写意见清楚。举重俯卧撑让自己变成。她会...是否被损坏。（她害羞，软，暂停加速快）展示她多么不同意，她确定他们用一个腔调说话。她穿很适合

##### 求同

动作描写

##### 求异

这就复杂了，整段文章必须把脉络全部吸收

### 技巧2：优先关注小词的作用（动词，连词，介词）

She loved it all. She and Scalia, despite the legal zingers he tossed in her direction, had been best buddies since their days together on the dc federal appeals court in the 1980s. And America’s highest court could be just as dramatic, even if more sombrely arrayed. There she sat, this tiny little woman perched among the black-robed men, and there she disagreed. For all but three of her 27 years she had one or two sisterly colleagues, but her opinions still marked her out. She berated the court when, in 2014, it let employers foist their religious beliefs on their workers by not paying for cover for contraception. She was outraged when, in the Citizens United case of 2010, it refused to limit corporate funding of independent political broadcasts, as if America had all the democracy that money could buy. And she especially attacked the striking down, in 2013, of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v Holder, on the supposition that racism had waned enough to discard it. That, she wrote, was “like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.”

### 技巧3：勤用逻辑

Yet she did not see herself as disruptive, let alone an activist. If she became more of a dissenter with the years, it was because the court, after 2006, swung over to the activist right. At heart she was still what she had always been, a judicial minimalist. She was stunned by the lack of caution in the Roe v Wade ruling of 1973 that legalised abortion; though she certainly approved of the outcome, reform should have come through state legislatures, where it was slowly starting to appear. She was shocked too when the court, while upholding Obamacare, found it illegal under the commerce clause of the constitution; that had been Congress’s domain since the 1930s. In her dissents she sometimes appealed to Congress to correct the law and occasionally, to her delight, it did.

### 英语能力倒逼：利用中文翻译

Her legal hero was an incrementalist: Thurgood Marshall, the first black justice on the court, who had laboured to dismantle segregation. Even when she was (as she operatically liked to say) a flaming feminist litigator, bringing cases before the Supreme Court in the 1970s on behalf of the Women’s Rights Project at the aclu, she saw herself first as a teacher, instructing the all-male court how women felt about laws which “protected” and thus demeaned them. She could have been furious about the prejudice she had faced herself, being Jewish as well as a woman: failing, for example, to get job offers from any New York law firm after leaving Columbia Law School, though she became the first tenured professor there. But she proceeded carefully, politely, case by case, and bad laws tumbled. When she joined the highest court her success rate fell, but her approach, as only the second woman there, was often the same: to explain to the male justices how it felt to be barred from the Virginia Military Institute or, as a teenage girl, to be strip-searched. Because the court just did not know these things.



她的法律界偶像是渐进主义者瑟古德·马歇尔（Thurgood Marshall）。马歇尔是美国最高法院第一位黑人大法官，毕生致力于消除种族隔离。上世纪70年代，她作为激昂的女权诉讼律师（她喜欢用歌剧风格来表达），代表美国民权联盟（ACLU）的女权计划向最高法院提起诉讼。即便在那时，她也先把自己当成老师，向清一色男性大法官的法庭阐明女性对号称“保护”实则贬低她们的法律的看法。尽管她后来成为哥伦比亚法学院第一位获得终身教职的女性，但是刚从法学院毕业那会儿，身为女性又是犹太裔的她在纽约的每一家律所都碰了壁。对自己遭受的偏见，她本可以怒不可遏，然而，她却稳扎稳打，不失风度地往前推进，通过一桩又一桩的案子，让糟糕的法律再也站不住脚（这一句话是否可以作为前一段的一个补充，就是在案子的判决结果可以反过来影响国会立法）。进入最高法院工作后，她斗争的成功率下降（这里不是胜诉率，因为进入最高法院之后她已经不再打官司，而更多的是作为大法官倡导一些法律的制定或者消除，或者对法律的解读和判决，继续推动平权，继续为每个人发声。也就是说不是单个案子的成功率，而是她倡导的议题的成功率），但她（对法律理想的追求）（作为那里仅有的两名女性大法官）一如既往：向男性大法官解释女性被弗吉尼亚军事学院拒收的痛楚，少女被强迫脱衣搜身的屈辱。因为最高法院并不了解这些。

#### 硬翻

Her law idol is xxxx TM. M is American Supreme Court Justice first black judge, dedecated in his life to eradicate rasism. In the last 70s, as a enthusiastic women right appeal atturney(she like to express in opera style), she represents ACLU female right plan to appeal to the Supreme Court.

##### 对答案

Her legal hero **was** *an incrementalist*: Thurgood Marshall, the first black *justice on the court*, who *had laboured to dismantle segregation*. Even when she **was** (as *she operatically liked to say*) a *flaming feminist litigator*, bringing cases before the Supreme Court in the 1970s on behalf of the Women’s Rights Project at the aclu, ***she saw herself first as a teacher***, *instructing* the all-male court *how women felt about laws* which **“protected” and thus *demeaned*** them.

## 剩下的一些技术

### 长难句分析

不会吧不会吧，不会还有人会觉得所谓长难句，即便存在，也不能**按正常语序读一遍拿下**吧？

### 对英语听说读写综合能力的影响

如果能做到从读到写转换，我觉得这四个之间继续转换都没有什么不懂的了。

### 如何学习

#### 内容学习

需要做好主题阅读。可以了解一下关于这位大法官的其他报道

#### 能力学习

简单来说，把它背下来就肯定掌握了所有能力

#### 考试思路学习

阅读，练习阅读过程；听力练习听录音的过程；口语练习从读/听到说的过程。写作练习读/听到写的过程。

#### 兴趣学习

摘抄就完了
